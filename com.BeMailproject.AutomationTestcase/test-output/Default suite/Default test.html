mansion about two miles from Woodbridge, on the 31st of March, 1809.  He
was the third son of John Purcell, who married his cousin Mary Frances
FitzGerald, and upon the death of her father in 1818 took the name and
arms of FitzGerald.  In 1816 Mr. Purcell went to France, and for a time
settled with his family at St. Germains.  FitzGerald in later life would
often speak of the royal hunting parties which he remembered seeing in
the forest.  They afterwards removed to Paris, occupying the house in
which Robespierre had once lived, and here FitzGerald had for his
drillmaster one of Napoleon's Old Guard.  Even at this early period the
vivacious humour which afterwards characterized him appears to have shewn
itself, for his father writing to some friends in England speaks of
little Edward keeping the whole family in good spirits by his unfailing
fun and droll speeches.  The dramatic circumstances of the assassination
of M. Fualdes, a magistrate at Rodez, in 1817, and the remarkable trial
which followed, fastened themselves on FitzGerald's memory, and he was
familiar with all the details which he had heard spoken of when quite a
child in Paris.  In 1821 he was sent to King Edward the Sixth's School at
Bury St. Edmunds, where his two elder brothers were already under the
charge of Dr. Malkin, who, like himself in after life, was a great
admirer of Crabbe. Among his schoolfellows were James., No, null, cdinhnguyen@outlook.com, null, null, null, null, No, test6.txt</td>
